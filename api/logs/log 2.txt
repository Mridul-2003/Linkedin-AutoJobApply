Seems like either... 

1. Chrome is already running. 
A. Close all Chrome windows and try again. 

2. Google Chrome or Chromedriver is out dated. 
A. Update browser and Chromedriver (You can run "windows-setup.bat" in /setup folder for Windows PC to update Chromedriver)! 

3. If error occurred when using "stealth_mode", try reinstalling undetected-chromedriver. 
A. Open a terminal and use commands "pip uninstall undetected-chromedriver" and "pip install undetected-chromedriver". 


If issue persists, try Safe Mode. Set, safe_mode = True in config.py
