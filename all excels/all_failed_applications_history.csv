Who We Are
Bain & Company is a global management consulting that helps the world’s most ambitious change makers define the future. Across 65 offices in 40 countries, we work alongside our clients as one team with a shared ambition to achieve extraordinary results, outperform the competition and redefine industries. Since our founding in 1973, we have measured our success by the success of our clients, and we proudly maintain the highest level of client advocacy in the industry.
Who You’ll work with

We work directly with other CoEs and Practices within Bain as part of the Expert Client Delivery system and interface with teams across the globe. We are first and foremost business thought partners working on intelligent ways of using analytical techniques and algorithms across the spectrum of disciplines that can enable building world-class solutions. Our goal is to build a disruptive high-impact business-enabled end-to-end analytical solutions delivery system across all verticals of Bain.
What You Will Do
We are seeking a strong candidate with experience in building applications around advanced analytics models, including front-end and back-end, and hosting said applications to fill an exciting Associate (AS) role within BCN Labs. The AS is expected to have a strong expertise in designing and building business-intuitive front-end interfaces and in setting up a robust back-end for our Machine Learning models and analytical solutions. The team has quite a few data scientists and the AS would have to interface with them on a day-to-day basis to enable the analytical solutions to be encapsulated within innovative, intuitive and seamless apps for end-clients and non-technical business leaders.
An AS is expected to have the ability to:
Collaborate with data scientists (who typically work with Python) to design and help build automated, deployable solutions using data orchestration tools (like AirFlow, etc.)
Develop and maintain front-end interfaces for data science applications, enhancing user experience and interaction with complex data sets.
Assist in the design and implementation of database solutions and data pipelines, supporting analytics and machine learning projects.
Lead the integration of Python-based models with databases via RESTful APIs, facilitating real-time data processing and analytics.
Employ Docker for application containerization and Git for version control, ensuring code quality and efficient team collaboration.
Successfully deploy multiple applications on AWS, optimizing cloud resources for cost-efficiency and scalability.
Contribute to the development of internal tools and platforms using technologies like Django and/or Streamlit to improve productivity and project delivery times.
Engage in continuous learning to stay ahead of emerging technologies and methodologies in data engineering and software development.
The AS is expected to have a knack for seeking out challenging problems and coming up with their own ideas which they will be encouraged to brainstorm with their peers and managers. They should be willing to learn new techniques and be open to solving problems with an interdisciplinary approach. They must have excellent coding skills and should demonstrate a willingness to be able to write modular, functional codes.
About You
A Masters or any other advanced degrees in a field linked to analytics such as Computer Science, Information Technology (IT), Operations Research, Engineering, etc.
If you are a Bachelors in any of the fields mentioned above, then we would seek a stellar academic record with proof of ability in not just implementing applications but also working through the end-to-end delivery cycle of analytical solutions including hosting
Excellent skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Ajax, working with APIs – RESTful or otherwise, a coding language such as C or JAVA and an intermediate exposure to Python.
Having skills and exposure to Django and/or Streamlit would be given preference, although it is not a mandatory requirement.
(Good-to-have, but not necessary) Exposure to either AWS or Azure with some experience of deploying Python based solutions on these cloud platforms, Airflow, Snowflake, PySpark, Git, Docker, etc.
You will fit into our team-oriented structure with a college/hostel-style way of working, having the comfort of reaching out to anyone for support that can enable our clients better
At least 1 or 2 years of demonstrated abilities in data engineering and software development if you are a Masters degree holder; and, at least 3 years of a stellar career track record if you are a Bachelors degree holder
Demonstrated abilities to manage and deliver data-driven projects
 What makes us a great place to work
We are proud to be consistently recognized as one of the world's best places to work, a champion of diversity and a model of social responsibility. We are currently ranked the #1 consulting firm on Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work list, and we have maintained a spot in the top four on Glassdoor's list for the last 12 years. We believe that diversity, inclusion and collaboration is key to building extraordinary teams. We hire people with exceptional talents, abilities and potential, then create an environment where you can become the best version of yourself and thrive both professionally and personally. We are publicly recognized by external parties such as Fortune, Vault, Mogul, Working Mother, Glassdoor and the Human Rights Campaign for being a great place to work for diversity and inclusion, women, LGBTQ and parents..
